## Core Features

### Multi-Zone Collaborative Dashboard

The main dashboard is divided into four functional areas:

- **Session Roadmap** – Visualization of session phases with assigned responsible members and progress status  
- **Task List** – Task management with filters by type and person, support for multiple assignments, and color-coded tags to identify responsible participants  
- **“Questions & AI” Panel** – A lab-style log for interactions with the AI tutor, with clear visual distinction between AI-generated content and official sources  
- **Group Status** – Real-time monitoring of participant focus, with an automatic alert system suggesting collaborative micro-breaks  

---

## Task Management System

- **Multiple assignment** – Tasks can be assigned to one or more participants via individual checkboxes or to the entire group using the “All” option  
- **Color-coded tags** – Immediate visual identification of the responsible members for each task  
- **Advanced filters** – Personalized views by activity type and participant  
- **Quick Actions** – Fast operations to efficiently manage tasks  

---

## Focus Mode

- **Structured intervals** – Concentration management through timed sessions  
- **Dedicated navbar** – Simplified interface during focus phases  
- **Dynamic goals** – Ability to add and track goals during the session  

---

## Intelligent Alert System

An automatic alert detects when multiple participants are struggling simultaneously and suggests collaborative micro-breaks to maintain collective productivity.

---

## Semantic Color Coding

A consistent visual system used throughout the application:

- 🟢 **Green** – Validated content, completed phases, finished tasks  
- 🟡 **Yellow** – Partial content, phases under review, ongoing tasks  
- 🔴 **Red** – Discarded content, required breaks, critical alerts

## AI Tutor with Critical Validation

An integrated intelligent assistant that provides responses with critical validation, visually distinguishing AI-generated information from official sources to ensure transparency and reliability.
